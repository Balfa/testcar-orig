# Testcar ðŸ“‹ðŸš—
An integration-testing sidecar for Kubernetes applications. Run integration tests automatically against newly deployed versions of your app. Integrate your build pipeline and fail the deployment if the tests fail.

# Quickstart

# Concepts
Testcar is a lightweight docker container that _can be_ (TODO: "can be" or "is"?) auto-injected into pods and will automatically find (by convention) and execute tests against the user container.

## Supported test frameworks
Currently only [Artillery](https://artillery.io/) scripts are supported.

## How it finds tests
Test scripts ... TODO

## How it reports results
Testcar outputs to Kubernetes logs (via stdout). A build-pipeline tool such as testcar-ado can be used to interpret the results and flag a deployment as successful or not.
